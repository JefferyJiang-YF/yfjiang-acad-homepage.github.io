Welcome to my academic portfolio. I am a dedicated researcher with a deep commitment to advancing the field of medical imaging and computer vision. My work primarily revolves around the development and refinement of multi-modal models, which integrate various forms of data to enhance learning and predictive accuracy.

Currently, I am engaged as a Part-Time Research Assistant (PT RA) at HKMU, where my research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Vision-Language Models (VLM). I am particularly fascinated by the potential of foundation models in transforming information retrieval systems, making them more intuitive and efficient.

Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical computer science and practical, impactful applications in healthcare and digital information systems. If you have any inquiries or need consultation, please feel free to contact me at [your email].

Join me as I explore the cutting-edge of technology and medicine, striving to innovate solutions that improve both diagnostics and accessibility to information.
